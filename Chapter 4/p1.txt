The grinch should use the following process to sort 2n players into two teams as unfairly as possible.

1)Assign each player a numerical skill rating.

2)Construct a min heap with all the players. O(nlog(n))

3)Extract the minimum rated player and store their name in an array of bad players. O(1)

4)delete that player from the heap and call heapify. O(nlog(n))

5)Once this has been done n times, all remaining players should be inserted into another array. O(n)

This algorithm generates two teams in the worst came time complexity o(nlog(n)).
