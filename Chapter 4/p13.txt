You wish to store a set of n numbers in either a max-heap or a sorted array.
For each application below, state which data structure is better, or if it does not matter. Explain your answers.

(a) Want to find the maximum element quickly.
A heap is better because, heap construction is O(n) while sorting is O(nlogn). Both have O(1)

(b) Want to be able to delete an element quickly.
Max heap is better because deletion takes O(logn) rather than O(n) when adjusting the positions of the elements in the sorted array.

(c) Want to be able to form the structure quickly.
Tie both take O(nlogn) to be built.

(d) Want to find the minimum element quickly.
Sorted array is better because the minimum element can be found in O(1).
